## Extension Privacy Policy
### Introduction
This extension utilizes personal data in various ways. The following privacy policy outlines the fundamental principles governing the collection and handling of personal data for extensions I create. Each individual extension, upon initial use, will present its unique privacy policy, requiring your agreement before continued usage.

### Data Collection
This extension does not collect any data whatsoever. Given the absence of data collection, it is evident, and indeed the case, that none of your data can be sold to third parties.

However, there are alternative ways in which your data is utilized.

### Chrome Storage API
My extensions leverage Google Chrome's Storage API to locally store minimal state information, similar to a cookie. Examples of data stored this way may include your Harvest account id and access token. Google synchronizes this information across your various computers and Chrome installations. Nevertheless, my extensions exclusively access this data locally on your machine, refraining from transmitting it.

## Third-Party APIs
My extension accesses third-party APIs and reports back the results. For instance, when you utilize the authorization button, it sends your account id to Harvest to generate an access token. Typically, when my extensions use these third-party API services, they transmit non-personal information about the page you are visiting. However, it's important to note that when extensions access a third-party API, certain personal information is included in the request header, notably your IP address and user agent string. Some companies employ this information to create a "browser fingerprint" that can potentially track and personally identify you. Unfortunately, this is beyond my control. If privacy concerns arise, consider using a VPN to mask your IP address.

### Changes to the Privacy Policy
In the event of substantial changes to this overarching privacy policy or to the individual privacy policies of any of my extensions, a new version of the affected extension will be released. Users will be prompted to agree to the revised privacy policy.

### Feedback
For any inquiries or concerns about this privacy policy, please feel free to send me an email or file an issue in this repository.
